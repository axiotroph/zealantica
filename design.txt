Planned mechanics:
- Attack patterns
- Action Economy
-  Activations as a resource
-  AP w/ diminishing returns to encourage smooth flow
-  AP debt, for magics you shouldn't have to plan around
- Magic
-  Primarily utility, magic as dps is rare
-  Gated by MP, a discrete resource
-  MP regen is very hard (impossible?) to increase
-  Certain spells (ex: mana seal) may additionally have cooldowns
- Stun

Should AP go negative: yes
- MP should be the only limiting factor on spells to allow tight balance

Surface MCP as a resource, call it MP
- Very hard to increase more than default regen (but not necessarily impossible; just can't make stunlocks free)
- Do not give spells cooldowns; make the balance so that if you can feed an excorcist enough MP to doublecast mana seal, you get to, just make that very hard
- Default regen can be statted per-class

Stats
- Attack
-- Damage of normal attack and physical scaling abilities (rare)
- Defense
-- Resistance to physical damage
- Magic Attack
-- Damage of magical scaling abilites and effects. All abilties should have at least one number that scales.
- Magic Defense
-- Opposes magic attack
- AP regen
- probably don't paramterize mp; just keep it simple turn counts
