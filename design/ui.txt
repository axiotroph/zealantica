Only think about battles for now

Need to show:
- units
- interface for selecting actions
- detail on selected/hovered unit
- detail on selected/hovered ability
- some sort of overall status state?
    Current turn, activations remaining, network info...


Plan:
  Units in the center
  Right pane is unitdetail/ability buttons/abilitydetail
  left pane is turn status and other general interface concerns
  terms can be explained by hovering
    allow selection of inactive units for this purpose
