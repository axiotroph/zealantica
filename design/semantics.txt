'effect': one minimal atomic, concrete change to the battle state
'eventResult': a logical grouping of effects
'event': a single "thing", like an ability being activated or triggered, or a turn change

The reason for this grouping is mostly
  - calculate all effects of a single event against the prior state
  - display them all together smartly
