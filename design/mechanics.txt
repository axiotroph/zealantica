Planned inclusions:
  Activations as a resource
  AP as a resource
    With diminishing returns (leads to sttacking steadily without being apparent to players)
    With debt (ap is too complex to reason about if magic will be ready)
  Magic
    Primarily for utility/control/metamagic; magic as dps is rare but does exist
    Gated by MP, which is magic-cooldown-points surfaced as a mechanic
      MP can be possible to interact with, but very difficult to give MP to someone else
      Individual spells could still hypothetically have a cooldown, but this can probably be avoided
    Actives, passives, trigger-passives
    Each spell has at least one numerical scaling value. It should matter, but an offset is acceptable.
      That is, it's okay for a spell to be primarially useful for its flat effect, 
      but int should still pay dividends if you're using that spell
  Stun
    For now, works as in original. This is necessary to give a strategic layer on top of 
    attack patterns and a sense of sente.
