Stats
- Attack
-- Damage of normal attack and physical scaling abilities (rare)
- Defense
-- Resistance to physical damage
- Health
-- Proportionally cheaper than defense
- Magic Attack (int)
-- Damage of magical scaling abilites and effects. All abilties should have at least one number that scales,
   and should in total be more or less linear.
- Magic Defense
-- Opposes magic attack
- AP regen
- probably don't paramterize mp; just keep it simple turn counts


Numbers
- Call 100 the base value for simplicity
- Buffs and modifiers should generally be constants, not multiples. That gives a very simple and understandable
  stacking implementation that still gives diminishing returns.


Formulas
Damage:
  Is there a reason to not just use base*attack/defense? (plus an offset for
  spells). It gives no opportunity for "no damage" effects, but I'm not sure
  that's really necessary in the first place.
