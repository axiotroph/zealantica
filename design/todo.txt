Progress:
  switch abilites over into returning events instead of applying directly to the unitstate
      Needed for animations and logs
  What about when an effect triggers something?
    It probably shouldn't be a new action when it's a stun, etc
    but it can be grouped into a new phase of effects
  Seek feedback
  UI Animations
  Randomness
  Sequencing battles
  Progression

Refactors:
  UI (should use reusable logic to layout elements)
  State (should have only one change per state, with a queue of triggers to process, so that we can see intervening states)
    Needed for animation and for some ai logic (properly handle no action between turns)
