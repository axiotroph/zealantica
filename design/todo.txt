Progress:
  some spells
  Surface more player log info (battle events, which also lead to animations)
  UI Animations
  Randomness
  Sequencing battles
  Progression

Refactors:
  UI (should use reusable logic to layout elements)
  State (should have only one change per state, with a queue of triggers to process, so that we can see intervening states)
    Needed for animation and for some ai logic (properly handle no action between turns)
