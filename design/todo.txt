Progress:
  Implement generic actions (guard, swap)
  Surface more player log info (battle events, which also lead to animations)
    this is needed for balance, hiding the numbers sucks
  Seek feedback
  UI Animations
  Randomness
  Sequencing battles
  Progression

Refactors:
  UI (should use reusable logic to layout elements)
  State (should have only one change per state, with a queue of triggers to process, so that we can see intervening states)
    Needed for animation and for some ai logic (properly handle no action between turns)
